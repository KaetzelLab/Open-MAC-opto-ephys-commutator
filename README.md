# If you are downloading files from zenodo

Please note that relative to v1.1 (currently only available on Zenodo, https://zenodo.org/record/7640543 ) this current version v1.2 contains two improvements:

 (i) The Top case B has been extended in length so that it can now be used for 4 of the 5 Open-MAC versions (12-channel SPI E-Phys, 24-channel SPI E-Phys, 1-channel RF miniscope, combined 12-channel SPI E-Phys/1-channel RF miniscope). As in previous versions, the combined E-Phys/Optogenetics version will require some minor modifications that we hope to release soon.

(ii) The bottom PCB design file, that suffered from one weak GND trace in v1.1 (but not in v1.0) has been updated, so that it is fully functional again.

Hence v1.1 is obsolete and v1.2, released here, should be used.
